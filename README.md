# bookshelf

A wholly original, truncated but otherwise accurate clone of Goodreads built with a MERN stack. Any data displayed inside the application have been obtained from the public Goodreads API.

Deployed live [here](https://goodreads-clone.herokuapp.com).

## † Important Update (10/12/2020) †

Unfortunately Goodreads has decided to permanently rm its public API that was integral to the functioning of this project. While it remains deployed at the above link, it is now essentially a defunct zombie-application.
